- 👋 Hi, I’m Rocio Holub
- 🌎 When I'm not working on a project or teaching myself something new, I travel the world (in non-COVID times anyway) 
- 🏄🏽‍♀️I like visiting countries where I can surf, scuba dive, or hike 
- ❤ I love all things Power Platform, Python, and data
- 🏫 I’m currently learning Python and JSON
- 📈 I lead the Washington D.C. Power BI Group with three of my favorite people! https://www.meetup.com/Power-BI-DC/
- 🥗 During COVID, I taught myself how to cook Mexican, Indian, Thai, and Chinese foods. I'm working on getting sushi right 🍣
